Creating web based Bullet Journal to expand coding skills. Project is going to reflect the asspects of a Bullet Journal.

## Folder Setup

Setup the python to include FastAPI and Motor. Created a venv using `python3 -m venv .venv`. I wanted my virtual environement dir to be hidden from the code itself. I then ran `source .venv/bin/activate` to start the virtual environment. Command is different for Windows.

## FastAPI Project Structure

Did some searching to help guide the projecte stucture, stumbled on zhanymkanov/fastapi-best-practices. Reading this had my going this route, but after working through the folder structure and getting some intial APIs going I may go back to a basic FastAPI project structure. I am jumping to fast for that strucutre for my current knowledge of programing. Going to restructure my folder to follow the basic FastApi directory structure.

# Day 5

Fixed data format issue with datetime and mongodb api call. Noticed a naming convention issue, so had to readress class and function names to reflect as entries instead of tasks. This was due to having tasks, notes, and events. I want to make sure that I can pull the diffent entries into different areas of the apps.

Created the NextJS frontend and was able to connect to my FastAPI backend and use GET API call to get all entries or just entries for the day.

I now have a foundation to continue to build on. There is a couple more initial API calls I have to create. As I develop more, I will probably need to create more calls.

I also have a very basic frontend that I now have to start building out.

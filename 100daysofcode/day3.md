# Day 3

## Refactor

Removed my structure and started over. I build directories slowly so I can build a better understanding of building an applicaiton.

I tood the pymongo module and fastapitutorial.com to start building the appication slowly. I am starting to build some connections on how the different files come to gether to build out the applicaiton.

I need to continue to work on building my models so I can then move on to my endpoints.

# Day 6

## File Restucture

Moved the python content to a backend folder, this allows a much cleaner project directory.

## Endpoints

Now that I got the frontend to connect to the backend yesterday. I can now put more focus on the backend. I started to add security content to the backend. I am now working with dependicies for FastAPI, so this may take a little to get a solid understanding. I was able to get my endpoints to require authentication.
